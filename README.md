# Responsive Bike Store Filter

This project is a dynamic bike store web application that allows users to filter bikes based on gender and brand. The data is fetched from an external JSON source, and the cards are generated dynamically using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cards:** The bike cards are created dynamically by looping through the product [data file](https://challenges.brainster.tech/ajax_data/data.json).
- **Sidebar Filters:** The sidebar contains filters to sort bikes by gender and brand.
- **Filter Badges:** Badges next to each filter show the number of products available under that category.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive. The navbar and filter section adjust their behavior and appearance depending on the screen size (works for both large screens and mobile devices).
- **Hover Effects:** Hover effects are implemented on bike cards (card image scales on hover).
- **Interactive:** Clicking on a filter (gender or brand) updates the bike cards on the screen, and the active filter is highlighted.
